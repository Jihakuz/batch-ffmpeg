# Batch ffmpeg
## Tom Flux

### Intro
This is a simple program that will run an ffmpeg command on multiple files. At the moment it only scales video and remvoes audio tracks.

This is useful for example when an anime has audio track for both Japanese and English, however you only want to keep the English track and cut down on file sizes. Instead of running every file through a program like handbrake, this program will do it all automatically.

### Installation
**FFMPEG IS REQUIRED** for this to work, along with Python 3+.
